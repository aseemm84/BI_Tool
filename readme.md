## 💡 AI-Generated Features

**🤖 Automated Data Cleaning**: Intelligently handles missing values by filling them with the median (for numbers) or mode (for categories/dates), removes duplicate rows, and automatically drops useless identifier-like columns (e.g., IDs, serial numbers).

**🔬 Advanced Analysis**: Instantly runs comprehensive analysis including key driver analysis, target variable influence assessment using mutual information, and uses machine learning models (Isolation Forest) to flag potential outliers in your data.

**🛠️ Hybrid Feature Engineering**: Automatically creates new features using `featuretools` (e.g., `SUM`, `MULTIPLY`) and provides an intuitive UI for you to manually create custom features based on your domain knowledge.

**📈 Optimized Segmentation**: Uses advanced clustering optimization with both Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to discover the optimal number of customer or data segments automatically.

**💡 AI-Generated Narratives**: Generates plain-English text summaries for every chart, explaining the key insight so you don't have to. It can identify trends, correlations, and key contributors in your visualizations.

**🎨 Interactive & Customizable Dashboards**: Build beautiful, interactive dashboards with a wide variety of charts (Bar, Line, Scatter, Donut, Heatmap, and more). Customize the layout, theme, colors, and even enter a full-screen "Presentation Mode" for a clean, professional look.
